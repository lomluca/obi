# OBI Master

## Code Structure
 - `master/autoscaler` code written for the autoscaler feature
 - `master/heartbeat` set of scripts and `protobuf` schemas used to run the
   heartbeat service on clusters master node and to collect them into OBI
   architecture
 - `master/model` definition of generic data structure, which define how each
   cluster should be interfaced
 - `master/persistent` code written to allow OBI to connect to a database for
   persisting its state
 - `master/platforms` implementations of the generic interfaces from
   `master/model`, capable of extending OBI to each possible cloud computing
   service
 - `master/pool` code allowing the handling of multiple cluster along with
   utility functions to allocate them
 - `master/predictor` contains code which is autogenerated to allow
   communication between OBI Master and the predictor component
 - `master/scheduling` contains the logic for the OBI scheduler
 - `master/utils` general utility functions
